# ## An unbeatable tic-tac-toe game
Implementing the minimax algorithm, this project allows you to play, but never win against the computer.  The user plays "X" first against the computer playing "O".

Try the game for yourself by building and running the code from inside the project directory:

- `go build . && ./ttt-minimax`

Or just run the docker container:

- `docker run --rm -ti mispelaur/ttt-minimax:latest`

You can also run the tests inside the project directory:

- `go test -v`
